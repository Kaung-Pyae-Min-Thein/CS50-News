#### Description: Publishing project for contents, mainly intent for publishing News.

At home page the user can see all of the contents uploaded by the authors. For who want to publish the content, the author can go to compose and write the content.

Finally, if they satisfied with their content, they can submit and leave. For the detail of the content, the reader can click "Read More" and read the full content. For who want to read from specific writer, the reader can select the writer name and read all of their news.

For techstack, I used node.js and express.js library for backend, EJS for view engine, MongoDB Atlas for Database, for easily connecting between server side and database, I used mongoose library. For easily styling, I used Bootstrap library.
